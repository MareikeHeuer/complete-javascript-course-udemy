/*
WHAT IS DOM AND DOM MANIPULATION?

- DOM: Document Object Model: Structured complete representation of HTML documents. 
  Allows JS to access HTML element and styles to manipulate them.

- DOM is automatically created by the browser as soon as the HTML document loads as a DOM tree

- DOCUMENT: Special object that is the entry point to the DOM
  EG: document.querySelector() 

- DOM methods and properties are NOT part of JS , they are part of Web APIs
- APIs are librearies also written in JS, and can interact with JS
